5Artists
========

An iOS Today Extension for Spotify Premium users.<br/>
Basically application needs user to login with Spotify first.<br/>
After that application grabs user's saved tracks and finds a root artist.<br/>
Next step is finding related artists of this root artist.<br/>
Final step is showing user the five artists.<br/>

This application uses [Spotify.framework](http://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk).<br/>
To build application succesfully you need to create an application on [Spotify Developer Site](http://developer.spotify.com) and create a .plist file named SpotifyKeys.plist. After that you need a token exchange server to run application.
